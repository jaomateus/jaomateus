### Junior Fullstack Web Developer

Hi there! I'm a recent graduate of Le Wagon, where I completed a full-stack web development course. Prior to this, I worked as a landscape architect and ran my own beach cafe, which focused on mostly organic, locally sourced and sustainable goods.
In my previous work as a landscape architect, I learned the importance of creating functional and aesthetically pleasing spaces. Now, as a web developer, I'm excited to bring those same principles to the digital realm and create solutions that are both visually appealing and user-friendly. I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and grow as a developer, and I'm eager to apply my skills and expertise to new challenges.

I'm currently learning Javascript and React.
