### Junior Fullstack Web Developer

I just finished a web development intensive course at Le Wagon, the world’s top rated bootcamp.  The experience turned out far above my expectations and made me determined to **switch to a career in web development.**
Even though I come from a creative background,  I was always very interested on exploring how technologies complement the creative process in order to achieve a better design and functional solution. 
I am curious about the metaverse and how web development and 3d Visualization will come together in the near future to shape our daily lives.

I'm currently learning Javascript and React.
